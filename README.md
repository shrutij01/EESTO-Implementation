# traj-plan
This repository consists of implementations of the three motion planners- STOMP (Stochastic Trajectory Optimzation for Motion Planning), EESTO (Energy Efficient Stochastic Trajectory Optimization) and an OGD based planner in the context of trajectory planning in a simulated ocean environment. Run any of EESTO.m, STOMP.m or main_online.m for each of the three planners respectively. Here, the ROMS dataset has been used for the ocean forecast data, which is in the NetCDF format and can be easily interepreted in Matlab. It is available online under the "U.S Governmnt Work" license.
